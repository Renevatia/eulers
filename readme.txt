Researcher -Calpico

In /answers WIP will have individual files and eventually be added as a function
into one cpp file using a main navigator to access individual computations.
Eventually we will use multiple files and organizations to separate the
computation and navigation functions. Once we finish a few sets of these we can
start implementing optimization efforts.

Main lanuguage:
C++
Java
Python

Potential language:
HTML5
PHP
Docker
C#
